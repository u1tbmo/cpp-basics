# **C++ Basics**

My Personal Project files containing the basics of C++

## Printing a line

Print a line of output displaying "Hello, World!"

## Printing multiple lines

Print multiple lines of output.

## Variables

Use variables to manage, store, and use different data values.

## Data Types

Use data types to store different types of data such as characters, strings, integers, and floating type numbers.

## Strings

Use the data type "string" which is used to store plain text.

## Numbers

Use the data types 'int', 'float', and 'double' which is used to store different numbers.  
Use numbers to use mathematical operations.

## User Input

Use 'cin' and 'getline' to obtain user input.

## Arrays

Use arrays to store various values in a single array.

## Functions

Use functions to do specific tasks separate from the main function.

## Return Statements

Use 'return' to make functions give information.

## If Statements

Use conditional statements such as if, else, and else if.

## Switch Statements

Use switch statements as a more efficient conditional statement.

## While Loops

Use while loops to create a looping piece of code.

## For Loops

Use for loops to create a looping and incrementing piece of code.

## Exponent Function

Create an exponent function will take a number value to a power.

## 2D Arrays

Use 2D Arrays where the elements of an array is an array.

## Nested Loops

Use Nested Loops to print a 2d array's elements.

## Comments

Create comments which are not executable by a machine.

## Pointers

Use pointers to store memory addresses.

## Classes and Objects

Create classes which are user-made data types.  
Create objects which are made from classes.

## Constructor Functions

Use constructors which will be called whenever an object of a class is created.

## Object Functions / Instance Functions

Use object functions which can be put inside of a class.

## Getters and Setters

Use getters and setters to control the access to different attributes and elements inside classes.

## Inheritance

Use inheritance to inherit attributes from another class.
